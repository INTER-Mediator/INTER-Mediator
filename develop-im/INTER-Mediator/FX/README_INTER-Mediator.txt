FX.php is developed by Chris Hansen et,al, and it could be used for FileMaker Server with PHP.

* FX.php website: http://www.iviking.org/FX.php/ *
* FX.php Souce code repository: https://github.com/yodarunamok/fxphp *
* This framework(INTER-Mediator) is neither affiliated with nor endorsed by Chris Hansen. *

INTER-Mediator requires FX.php to access the FileMaker Server. FX.php already includes INTER-Mediator distribution.
FX folder of INTER-Mediator doesn't contain full FX.php files. If you need to check all files, refer to above sites.

I'm contributing FX.php for supporting Unicode characters.

Thanks for Chris and FX.php developers.
